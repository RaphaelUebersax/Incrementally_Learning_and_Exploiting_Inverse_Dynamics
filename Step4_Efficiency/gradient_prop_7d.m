% THIS FUNCTION RETURNS INDEX OF THE DATAPOINT IN THE CANDIDATE POOL THAT
% IS CLOSEST TO THE CURRENT DATAPOINT + GRADIENT(VARIANCE)*STEP
%
% Input: - Candidate_pool : (MxP+2) M datapoints of [P-dimensions, target, RBD]
%        - x_current      : (1xP) Last considered datapoint of dimension P
%        - step           : (double) Length of the gradient vector to add
%        - GPR            : (struct) Structure containing all GP Regressor
%
% Ouput: - idx            : (int) Index of next data in Candidate_pool
