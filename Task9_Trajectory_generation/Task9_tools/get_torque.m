%
% THIS FUNCTION GETS THE TORQUE CORRESPONDING TO (Q,QDOT,0) USING THE 
% NEURAL NETWORK IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON TRAINED ON THE MICE DATASET.
%
% inputs: - q   : (Nx7) Joint state positions of the iiwa14 robot
%         - qdot: (Nx7) Joint state velocities of the iiwa14 robot
%
% ouputs: - tau: (Nx7) Torques of each joint

% Execute python script
!python learning/ANN_coupled/scripts/testModels.py

% Read the results of the NN
