## Structure of this step:

1) ANN_Full: 
	> Folder containing the pretrained neural network collected during the MICE project as well as multiple data files related to it.

2) data:
	> Folder containing the data computed by the inverse kinematics solver for the Linear DS as well as polar DS

3) Images:
	> Folder contraining figures resulting from the different experiments.

4) learning:
	> Folder containing the different scripts required for the inference of the neural network.

5) Task9_tools:
	> Helper functions for task9

6) Compute_regions_IK.m:
	> Script to compute the joint configurations of interest to execute a specific task with the robot.

7) Trajectory_generation_main_GMM.m:
	> Script that applies the first iteration of the second inter-cluster exploration approach to the data computed by a Linear DS
