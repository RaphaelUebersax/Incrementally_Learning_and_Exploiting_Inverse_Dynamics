# Incrementally_Learning_and_Exploiting_Inverse_Dynamics
Semestre Project at LASA, EPFL

This code is used for the study that aims at exploring the robot's configuration space in order to learn accurately the inverse dynamics model required to execute a specific task. This is achieved through deploying a probabilistic regression model online used to extract and optimize the most informative set of trajectories.



## Requirements:

> Matlab 9.9 (R2020b)

	> Robotics System Toolbox - version 3.2 

	> Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox - version 12.0  
      
> gurobi 9.1.2

> python 3.8.12

> torch 1.7.1



## Preliminary step:

Add iiwa Kuka 14 inverse dynamics dataset collected at LASA in the data folder under the name 'gprProcessedActualData.csv'



## Information

Steps 1 to 4 are used for section 3 of the report, namely the incremental learning part. Steps 5 to 9 are then for section 4 of the report which aims at developing an online model learning framework using joint's phase space exploration.

Note that each step is briefly detailed in the structur section and complementary information can be found at the beggining of each script.



## Structure:

1) data: 
	> robot's urdf file
