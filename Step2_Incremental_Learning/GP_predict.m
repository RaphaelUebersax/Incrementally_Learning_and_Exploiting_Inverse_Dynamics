% This function trains a Gaussian Process Regression on the training data
%
% Inputs: - X_train:    (MxP) Matrix containing M datapoints of dimension P
%         - x_test:     (1xP) Vector containing 1 datapoint of dimension P
%         - alpha:      (Mx1) Coefficien vector
%         - RBD_x_test: (double) Rigid body dynamics of the test datapoint
%         - Sigma_rbf
%
% Outputs: - Torque:    (double) Torque prediction for new datapoitn x
