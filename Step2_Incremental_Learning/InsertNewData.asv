% This function adds a new point to the dictionnary containing the GP model
%
% Inputs: - K:          (DxD) Gram Matrix of current dictionary
%         - dict:       (DxP) Current datapoint in dictionnay
%         - x_new:      (1xP) Point to add to dictionnary
%         - Sigma_rbf   (double) Lengthscale of the RBF kernel
%
% Outputs: - dict_new:  (D+1xP) Updated Dictionnary 
%          - Knew:      (D+1xD+1) Updated Gram Matrix
